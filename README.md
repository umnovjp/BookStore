# BookStore
## Purpose
This app will help a user to find new books to read using Google book search. A user can search for books entering queries such as a title or an author. ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/88174852/150915877-aee13ad1-cb0f-4659-9834-df2ca04cf2ec.png)
When books show up, user can save some of them. There is Save button under each book description. There are also login and signup features. Save book will only work when a user is logged in. As this readme is being populated, I still continue working on the app. Recent change is taht I can read saved book info in console.log, but I still see an error message. ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/88174852/151102888-b1b74ae8-6682-4c52-96b2-45ec593e9fda.png)

## Meeting technical requirements
App has files structure according to requirements. On server side, I have server.js and auth.js files. I created schemas directory with three required files, with queries and mutations defiuned. On client side, I created queries.js, App.js and mutations.js files. I modified SearchBooks and SavedBooks file to use new technology. Develop folder did not have SignupForm.js and LoginForm.js files mentioned in the assignment.
