# BookStore
## Purpose
This app will help a user to find new books to read using Google book search. A user can search for books entering queries such as a title or an author. When books show up, user can save some of them. There is Save button under each book description. There are also login and signup features. 
## Meeting technical requirements
App has files structure according to requirements. On server side, I have server.js and auth.js files. I created schemas directory with three required files, with queries and mutations defiuned. On client side, I created queries.js, App.js and mutations.js files. I modified SearchBooks and SavedBooks file to use new technology. Develop folder did not have SignupForm.js and LoginForm.js files mentioned in the assignment.
