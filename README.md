# BookStore
## Purpose
This app will help a user to find new books to read using Google book search. A user can search for books such as a title or an author, or login.

## Meeting technical requirements
App has files structure according to requirements. On server side, I have server.js and auth.js files. I created schemas directory with three required files, with queries and mutations defiuned. On client side, I created quries.js, App.js and mutations.js files. I modified SearchBooks and SavedBooks file to use new technology. There was may be an error in home work assignmenmt because Develop folder did not have SignupForm.js and LoginForm.js files. That was likely reason why Login / Signup page did not work.
